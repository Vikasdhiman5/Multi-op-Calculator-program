## 🎓 Internship Acknowledgement

This project was built during the **Cryptonic Area Python Porgramming Virtual Internship Program**.

### Learning Outcomes

While building this project, I learned:

- How to create and use functions in Python
- How to take user input and convert it to numeric values
- How to apply conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- How to handle runtime errors such as division by zero
- How to organize code in a clean and readable manner
- How to write proper documentation using README.md

This project helped me improve my logical thinking, programming skills, and confidence in Python development
